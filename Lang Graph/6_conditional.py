Review  = "my email is kingfahad@gmail.com After having lived in Africa for more than seven years (Mozambique) in addition to now frequently traveling for work I thought I had seen everything. In terms of poor management, traveling with Air Senegal was surprisingly bad. No communication or information, clueless staff and no compensation or willingness to assist passengers (elderly, young, families etc.). My flight from Dakar to Praia was 5hrs late, which was more than the average delay on their flights (3.5hrs). The aircraft supposed to take us to Praia departed for Conakry at the same time as we were supposed to take-off. After speaking with ground staff it became clear that itâ€™s a management strategy/policy - they simply plan more flights (thus, sell more tickets) than their fleet is capable of handling. The operation side of the company have their hands tied as they dont have enough aircrafts or staff to operate according to the route network and timetable, which is reflected on their constant delays."
