      "  \"essay\": \"\\nThere is a sense of complexity today that has led many to believe the individual investor has little chance of competing with professional brokers and investment firms. However, Malkiel states this is a major misconception as he explains in his book \\u201cA Random Walk Down Wall Street\\u201d. What does a random walk mean? The random walk means in terms of the stock market that, \\u201cshort term changes in stock prices cannot be predicted\\u201d. So how does a rational investor determine which stocks to purchase to maximize returns? Chapter 1 begins by defining and determining the difference in investing and speculating. Investing defined by Malkiel is the method of \\u201cpurchasing assets to gain profit in the form of reasonably predictable income or appreciation over the long term\\u201d. Speculating in a sense is predicting, but without sufficient data to support any kind of conclusion. What is investing? Investing in its simplest form is the expectation to receive greater value in the future than you have today by saving income rather than spending. For example a savings account will earn a particular interest rate as will a corporate bond. Investment returns therefore depend on the allocation of funds and future events. Traditionally there have been two approaches used by the investment community to determine asset valuation: \\u201cthe firm-foundation theory\\u201d and the \\u201ccastle in the air theory\\u201d. The firm foundation theory argues that each investment instrument has something called intrinsic value, which can be determined analyzing securities present conditions and future growth. The basis of this theory is to buy securities when they are temporarily undervalued and sell them when they are temporarily overvalued in comparison to there intrinsic value One of the main variables used in this theory is dividend income. A stocks intrinsic value is said to be \\u201cequal to the present value of all its future dividends\\u201d. This is done using a method called discounting. Another variable to consider is the growth rate of the dividends. The greater the growth rate the more valuable the stock. However it is difficult to determine how long growth rates will last. Other factors are risk and interest rates, which will be discussed later. Warren Buffet, the great investor of our time, used this technique in making his fortune.\",\n",
      "  \"language_feedback\": \"The essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and incorporates relevant information from Malkiel's book. However, the language usage is somewhat informal and repetitive. The vocabulary is adequate but could be more sophisticated. Grammatical errors and awkward syntax are present throughout the essay, hindering clarity. For instance, there are issues with subject-verb agreement, sentence structure, and word choice. Improving sentence construction and diversifying vocabulary would enhance the essay's overall quality.\",\n",
      "  \"clarity_feedback\": \"The essay demonstrates a basic understanding of investment concepts but suffers from a lack of clarity and coherence. The paragraph structure is weak, with ideas not always logically connected. The introduction is abrupt, and the essay jumps between different aspects of investment without a clear focus. There are also grammatical errors and awkward phrasing throughout the essay which detracts from its readability. To improve, focus on creating a clear thesis statement, organizing ideas into well-defined paragraphs, and using transitions to connect them smoothly. Proofreading for grammar and clarity is also essential.\",\n",
      "  \"analyse_feedback\": \"The essay provides a good overview of Malkiel's concepts of investing versus speculating and introduces the firm-foundation theory. However, it lacks a clear stance on whether individual investors can compete with professionals. The analysis could be deeper by exploring the limitations of the firm-foundation theory and the challenges individual investors face in applying it. The logical flow is decent, but the essay feels more like a summary than a critical analysis. The arguments presented are somewhat weak without concrete examples or a clear connection to the initial statement about individual investors.\",\n",
      "  \"overall_feedback\": \"**Strengths:**\\n\\n*   **Clear Understanding of Source Material:** The essay demonstrates a solid grasp of Malkiel's book and its key concepts.\\n*   **Definitions Provided:** Important terms like \\\"random walk,\\\" \\\"investing,\\\" and \\\"speculating\\\" are clearly defined, aiding comprehension.\\n*   **Explanation of Theories:** The essay explains the \\\"firm-foundation theory\\\" in a relatively easy-to-understand way.\\n*   **Use of Examples:** The reference to Warren Buffett adds weight to the explanation of the firm-foundation theory.\\n\\n**Weaknesses:**\\n\\n*   **Lack of Original Argument/Analysis:** The essay primarily summarizes and defines concepts from the book. It lacks a clear thesis statement or original argument about the material presented.\\n*   **Descriptive, Not Analytical:** The essay is more descriptive than analytical. It explains *what* the theories are, but doesn't really analyze their strengths, weaknesses, implications, or relevance to the prompt (if there was one).\\n*   **Weak Introduction and Conclusion:** The opening sentence hints at a potential argument but the essay doesn't develop it. There is no concluding statement to tie the ideas together.\\n*   **Potentially Off-Topic:** Without knowing the original IELTS prompt, it's difficult to assess if the essay directly answers the question. It reads more like a book report than an argumentative essay.\\n*   **Language Issues:** The essay has noticeable grammatical errors (\\\"there\\\" vs \\\"their\\\").\\n*   **Structure:** The structure is quite basic and lacks clear transitions between ideas.\",\n",
